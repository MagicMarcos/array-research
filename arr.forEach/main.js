/////description////
    // forEach() calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array in ascending index order. It is not invoked for index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized.

//     callbackFn is invoked with three arguments:

//         the value of the element
//         the index of the element
//         the Array object being traversed

    //does not mutate the array on which it is called. (However, callbackFn may do so)

////how it works////
     //method that loops through each element in an array and executes the provided function
